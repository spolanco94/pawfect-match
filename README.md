# Pet Adoption Portal
## Overview
This project is a front-end page designed to attract users to explore a pet adoption website. The goal is to practice building user experience by incorporating stronger HTML5 practices, including accessibility and complex form field support. The design will use flexbox and/or grid with CSS to create a visually appealing and user-friendly layout.

## Planned Features
* **Pet Showcase**: Display images and information about available pets for adoption.
* **Adoption Survey Form**: A form for users to fill out if they're interested in adopting a pet, with support for more complex form fields.
* **Accessibility**: Ensure the page is accessible to users with disabilities, following best practices for semantic HTML and ARIA attributes.
* **Responsive Design**: Use CSS flexbox and/or grid to create a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes.
* **Engaging Visuals**: Use high-quality images and a visually appealing design to attract users and encourage exploration of the site.

## Technologies
* HTML5
